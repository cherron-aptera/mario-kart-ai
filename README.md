# Rumble in the Retro Gym: Mario Kart AI Showdown
Brock vs Clint, Q1 2020

## The Objective
To learn Machine Learning techniques in a fun and interactive way.

## The Venue
Super Mario Kart, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

## The Challenge
Each participant will create a Mario Kart AI to pit against the others and see whose 'bot can top the leaderboards.

**Bonus**: If we can figure out how to pit the 2 players against each other and have them race head-to-head in real-time, then that sounds awesome.
