# Rumble in the Retro Gym: Mario Kart Showdown
Brock vs Clint, Q1 2020

## The Objective
To learn Machine Learning techniques in a fun and interactive way.

## The Challenge
Let's each create Mario Kart AI and pit them against each other to see whose 'bot can top the leader boards.



**Bonus**: If we can figure out how to pit the 2 players against each other and have them race head-to-head, then that sounds awesome.
